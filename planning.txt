ok let's try to make the UI first
let's see...
a home page of sorts
with one option for taking a picture
and then another to bring you to the albums page?

on home page, press button --> take picture --> redirect back to home
    in terms of backend, maybe just save the picture to a default folder?
on home page, press button --> go to albums --> display various folders maybe
    default and any user-created ones
    albums page needs way to create new album / delete album / etc. I suppose

honestly what's the point of this project lol it seems so useless

if there was a way to integrate it into like google drive or something that'd be cooler

but anyway

there are 2 main capture-image functions I think
one is just captureImage
and the other is the preview one

I don't think the preview one is too useful right now
so maybe the idea is you do capture image and then download the image from the camera to the computer
and then display it

so take picture --> redirect to image display page where it shows the picture you just took

for the albums thing, that means that when you download the image to the computer, it gets put into a specific
default album folder

and then options to manage the album folders basically
and view specific images

so is that it then?
